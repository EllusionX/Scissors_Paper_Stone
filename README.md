# Scissors_Paper_Stone
A web Scissors_Paper_Stone Game

### About the Project (Status: Complete)
This is a small project of Scissors_Paper_Stone AKA Rock_Paper_Scissors. I code it without researching much on how to create a proper game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used what I have learn and started creating it.
